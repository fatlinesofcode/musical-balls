Here is something fun I put together today.
Its a bouncing balls collision animation. When the balls collide they play a familiar tune.
Make sure you try it on your iPad or iPhone as the sounds work via the web audio api (on iOS6+)
and tilting the screen will change the direction the balls are traveling.
